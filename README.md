For the favicons I used the [carrot image](https://github.com/twitter/twemoji/blob/master/assets/svg/1f955.svg) from the [Twemoji project](https://github.com/twitter/twemoji/tree/master) by Twitter, Inc. and other contributors which is licensed under the [CC-BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

Used https://favicon.io/emoji-favicons/ for generating the favicons.
